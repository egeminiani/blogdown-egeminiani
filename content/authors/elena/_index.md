<br> <div style="text-align: justify"> Hello, welcome to my site! I am a postdoc in Statistics at the University of Bologna. I am enthusiastic about doing anything at the intersection between statistical methodology and computational science. My research interests include multivariate analysis, dimension reduction, text analysis, and optimization. I have spent research periods abroad at the London School of Economics, University College London, KU Leuven, and University of Glasgow (double BSc degree). I am a teaching tutor in three undergraduate and postgraduate courses. </div>

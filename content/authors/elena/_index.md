<br> <div style="text-align: justify"> Hello! I am a business analytics and data science professional at ICONSULTING. I am a Statistics PhD, and a former researcher in statistics and psychometrics, with experience at several universities including London School of Economics, University College London, KU Leuven, and University of Glasgow. I am enthusiastic about anything at the intersection between statistics and computational science, particularly predictive modelling, multivariate and latent variable models, and dimension reduction.  </div>
